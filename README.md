# CS360project
This mobile app project was focused on building a Weight-Tracking App that supports users in setting and reaching health or fitness goals. The core user needs it addresses include tracking daily weight entries, setting a personal goal weight, and receiving feedback through notifications once goals are achieved. To support these goals, the app includes a login screen, a daily weight input screen, a goal weight setup screen, and a progress display. These screens were designed with user-centered principles in mind: clean layouts, limited distractions, and a clear flow from login to daily tracking. I prioritized simplicity so users of any tech background could interact with the app without confusion.

When coding the app, I followed modular and reusable structures, using Java with Android Studio and SQLite to manage local data storage. I focused on clear UI-component-to-database connections, especially for input validation and goal checks. One technique that worked well was structuring each UI interaction as a function tied to the database operations, which kept everything clean and testable. These strategies, especially separating UI and logic will be useful in future projects for both debugging and scalability.

To ensure the app was functional, I used both emulator-based testing and manual test cases. I checked each screenâ€™s responsiveness, confirmed input validation, and ran multiple data entry scenarios. This helped uncover UI inconsistencies and gave insight into how real users might interact with the app. One of the most challenging aspects was maintaining smooth navigation while preserving each screen's function and simplicity. Solving this meant reworking the layout logic and adjusting the UI structure multiple times.

Overall, I was especially successful in building a consistent, responsive UI with integrated database operations that delivered the core functionality in a user-friendly way. This project strengthened my understanding of mobile UI/UX design and backend integration, and gave me experience in delivering a complete, functional app from planning to deployment.
